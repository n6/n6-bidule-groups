bidule-groups
=============
Here you'll find some of hopefully useful custom bidule groups. All groups are built using common Building Blocks (no external plguins, etc.). 

These Bidule groups specifically work with http://www.plogue.com/products/bidule/. So you'll need a copy to run any of them.

NoiseSynth
==========
My attempt at nearly random noise generation. Two LFOs modify the group's parameters.
